[2022-07-22  1:40 PM] metlslime: @Nieb yes that was me
[2022-07-22  3:31 PM]      Nieb: @metlslime Pleasure to meet ya.
                                 I've taken the liberty of recreating metl1 in Sauerbraten,
                                 do you mind if we include it in the game?

                                 Totally cool to include it.
